      The Alive system was created by the Beamline Controls
      Group of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National
      Laboratory, in order to monitor the EPICS IOCs for which it
      is responsible.  This monitoring consists mainly of current
      operational status and boot configuration parameters.
      Clients access data by connecting with the systems's central
      server over the network, and there are both command line and
      web clients.  The system is designed to be a mission-critical
      component of beamline operations, supporting several hundred
      IOCs.
