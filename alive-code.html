    <p>
      All of the code for the alive system is written in C.  The alive
      record module has no external dependencies other than EPICS
      libraries and should build on any of the supported platforms for
      EPICS.  The rest of the system has no external dependencies, and
      was developed with the <b>gcc</b> compiler for Linux.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Alive Record</h2><hr>
        
    <p>
      The Alive record support has a fairly straightforward design.
      It only needs a remote host IP address to be provided so it
      knows where to send the heartbeat messages, and most other
      fields have defaults that can be overrriden.  The heartbeat
      functionality can be disabled, and it can requests that the
      remote server read it's configuration information.  Its output
      value is the number of heartbeats that have been sent, so it
      increases over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a little different from a typical record in that it does
      nothing when processed, as the sending of heartbeats is done
      periodically according to a time interval set at startup.  This
      is to prevent the record from flooding the remote server with
      hearbeat packets in case something causes the record to process
      constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record spawns a separate thread that handles requests
      to its open TCP port.  When a connection is made, it checks to
      see if the remote address corresponds to the central repository,
      and if it doesn't closes it.  Otherwise, it ignores any input
      and simply sends all of the environmental variables and
      operating system dependant infomation before closing the
      port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record sends operating system specific information to the
      server when it is queried for configuration information, but
      only for certain ones (more operating systems can be added in
      the future): vxWorks, Linux, Windows, and MacOS.  For example,
      the user account, user group, and host are sent for Linux IOCs.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Alive Daemon</h2><hr>

    <p>
      The daemon is threaded in design.  The database server, its
      major subsystem, utilizes multiple threads.  There are
      also two access service threads, and a notification management
      service thread (not fully implemented).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are five different network access modes for the daemon:
      <ul>
        <li>Incoming IOC UDP heartbeat receiver, within database
          subsystem.</li>
        <li>Outgoing TCP connection to call IOCs back, for retrieving
          the IOCs configuration information, within database
          subsystem.</li>
        <li>Control interface on an IPC socket, for the local control
          program access.</li>
        <li>Incoming TCP data query interface, which communicates
          to the API library.</li>
        <li>Incoming and outgoing UDP event notification interface,
          which communicates to the API library, within notification
          management subsystem (not fully implemented).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, there is a set of file system function calls, for
      saving and retrieving boot state information, as well as logging
      and retrieving IOC events.
    </p>
        
    <h3>In-Memory Database Subsystem</h3>
        
    <p>
      The daemon's primary job is to be a database server.  The
      database is written as in-memory and online. It handles a
      constant stream of heartbeat packets efficiently, and the
      querying of the database needs to have little impact on this. It
      periodically determines the states of the IOCs that it monitors,
      by checking if the last heartbeat is outside the timeout window
      (determined by threshold number of missing packets multiplied by
      heartbeat period).
    </p>

    <!-- <img src="html-files/llrb.png" align="right"> -->

    <p>
      The database uses a key-value data store called a red-black
      tree.  In particular, it is using a variant called the
      <a href="html-files/LLRB.pdf">left-leaning red-black tree</a>, which
      simplifies the implementation somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A red-black tree works well as it acts like a binary tree for
      searching, which is fairly efficient.  For insertion, it will
      force a good level of balancing for the data across the tree,
      for reasonable amount of work and in any order the data is
      added.  As with all autobalancing trees, deletion is not
      trivial; it has to not unbalance the tree, but also leave it in
      an expected configuration for future insertions.  The alive
      database only does deletions when explictly told through the
      control program, so large deletion overhead is not a problem.
      The code is written using recursion to keep implementation
      simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there are many possible concurrent accesses to the database
      across several threads, locking is enabled on the data store
      with global and record locking.  Global implementation uses the
      single writer-many reader model, with priority given to the
      writer.  So, many readers can access the database at the same
      time, but when a writer wantes to write, no more readers are
      allowed access until the writer is finished.  The writer mode is
      needed when a new IOC is added or an existing one is deleted.
      Record locking is used along with reader access when information
      is being changed for an existing IOC.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to remove manual locking of the database, all access to
      the data store are done through function callbacks.  A function
      is provided that does the necessary work with a data object, and
      it is given to the data store to use with any matching data
      object.  This does two things: it allows the locking to be done
      by the datastore behind the scenes, and it forces the programmer
      to minimize the time that any locking will be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an IOC's data is accessed in the database, no blocking
      behavior is allowed, which forces a need to copy the data for
      its processing outside of the database.  However, making full
      copies can become expensive.  Instead, shared buffers of the
      information are used, which use reference counters. The database
      gives a pointer to the shared buffer to the routine wanting
      access, which will release it when it is done.  In the mean
      time, if the record is updated, the database drops its reference
      to the old version and creates a new one, leaving the old one
      around until it has no references.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separate process threads are started with the database, and this
      is what they handle:
      <ul>
        <li>A permanent thread receives the hearbeat packets on a UDP
          port, processes them, and applies the IOC information to the
          data store.  It also can determine that an IOC is: newly up,
          recovered, has a conflict, or has a new message value.</li>
        <li>Temporary threads are generated when it's necessary to
          contact an IOC's alive record on it's open TCP port, and
          when it's necessary to write a IOC change of state to disk.
          As network traffic and file writing can block, this can't be
          done in the thread that accepts heartbeats, which needs to
          process continuously.</li>
        <li>A permanent thread periodically scans the database to see
          if any IOCs have instances that timed out, possibly
          resulting in determinations of IOC failure or conflict
          resolution.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also several access functions, which remove the need
      for interacting with callback functions, doing the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Database starting and stopping.</li>
        <li>IOC general information retrieval.</li>
        <li>IOC instances retrieval.</li>
        <li>IOC conflict information retrieval.</li>
        <li>IOC deletion.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Event Notification Management Subsystem</h3>

    <p><i>This feature is not fully implemented.</i></p>

    <!--
    <p>
      When events are generated by the database, they need to be sent
      to the event subscribers.  This process is done with a separate
      process thread, and is done using a custom UDP networking
      protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom UDP protocol allows for a single port on the server
      to communicate with multiple subscribers simultaneously, with no
      worrying about TCP timeouts slowing down notification.  Each
      event is sent as a single UDP packet to each subscriber, and
      delivery is guaranteed through the use of acknowledgement
      packets.  Each event packet contains the event and the full
      information for that IOC, to allow flexible filtering of events
      by the subscription client.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription is accomplished by the client establishing a
      connection.  Periodic heartbeats are subsequently sent by the
      subscriber to the daemon to maintain its subscription; the
      daemon's response lets the client know that the daemon is still
      active. Unsubscribing for a subscriber is to simply stop sending
      the heartbeats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subscriber entries are kept in a left-leaning red-black tree
      for easy access and traversal (sharing that code with the main
      database).  Each subscriber entry keeps a linked list of events
      that need to be sent and acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an event arrives at the service, it's added to a global
      linked list of events, as well as to each linked list of active
      subscribers.  The service periodically sends event notifications
      to outstanding events until they are acknowledged, otherwise it
      eventually drops the subscriber.  Once an event acknowledged,
      the subscriber entry will drop it from its linked list, and once
      the number of references for an event is zero, it will be
      dropped from the global linked list of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the client point-of-view, the subscription process is done
      through the alive C API.  A handler function is given to the API
      that is run every time that an event is sent to the client, to
      process the IOC event and information however it wants.
    </p>

-->
    
    <h3>Data Access</h3>
    
    <p>
      Access to the database data is done through the alive C API,
      which allows access over the network.  It can provide a full or
      partial listing of the IOCs in the database, with their statuses
      and details.  It can provide a more detailed representation for
      an IOC, which can contain multiple recent IOC instances, and is
      typically used for debugging or solving a naming conflict.
      Lastly, it can provide a historical event listing for an IOC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The API interface is designed to be simple to use.  The client
      needs the server's IP address, and optionally IOC names.  The
      data is returned as a array of structures, with the structure
      layout corresponding to what was asked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the daemon, a dedicated thread provides a TCP port that
      allows connections.  If current information is requested for
      IOCs, then a request is made to the in-memory database, where
      shared pointers are used to provide a static snapshot of the
      information before it is sent to the remote client.  If a
      request is made for event data, then the event file for that IOC
      is loaded off of disk and sent to the client.
    </p>

    <h3>On-Disk Database</h3>
        
    <p>
      Data storage in a file system is needed for a couple reasons.
      One is to allow a graceful restart of the daemon while the IOCs
      are still running.  It is also used to log events for IOCs, as
      there is no reason to keep that information in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the daemon is restarted while the IOCs are still running, the
      states of all the IOCs in the network will be lost.  There is
      then no way to detect a failure or reboot that occurs during the
      restart of the daemon.  This is handled by keeping a simple
      database on disk, in the form of a directory with a file for
      each IOC. Whenever the daemon queries an IOC for its
      configuration information, it will get written into that IOC's
      file, along with the IOC active state; whenever IOC's state
      changes, the status part of its file is overwritten.  When the
      daemon starts, it will read all the files from the directory,
      creating entries matching the file names, and populates each
      entry with the data from its file.  This restores the identities
      and information of all the IOCs, even if some are not currently
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IOC events are logged into separate files for each IOC.  The
      events are loged with the time, the IP address, and the user
      message value.  These events can also be retrieved as part of a
      user request for them.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Alive Control Program</h2><hr>
        
    <p>
      Once the daemon is started, it runs in the background.  There
      has to be some method of communicating with it, which is done
      using the control program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to reduce the chance of accidental administrative
      access of the database, an IPC socket is used and not a network
      socket.  This way, access has to be done while logged into the
      host running the daemon, and the host can be chosen so that it
      has restricted access.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code design itself is straightforward, and mostly relays
      commands to the daemon and its responses back to the user.
