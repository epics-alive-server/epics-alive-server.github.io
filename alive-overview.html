    <h2>Alive System Operation</h2><hr>
      
    <img src="html-files/alive.png" align="right">
    
    <p>
      The Alive system is composed of several components, working
      with each other over a network.  In the network diagram,
      there are three layers.  The top layer contains the IOCs,
      which can be running on dedicated hardware like VME or as
      processes (single or multiple) on Linux hosts.  The middle
      layer consists of alive services: the alive database server
      and the CGI clients that reside at the web server.  The
      bottom layer consists of the user clients, which can be web
      clients or simple command line clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      As EPICS IOCs compose a distributed control system consisting
      of peer nodes with no leader, monitoring the IOCs involves
      communication with each one.  Each IOC sends hearbeat
      messages to a central alive server, and allows queries
      about's its boot configuration; this is done with an alive
      record on each IOC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central alive server communicates accepts heartbeats from
      any IOC, will query IOCs for their boot parameters, and
      stores the information in an in-memory database.  On this
      same server as the daemon, a program can be run to locally
      control or monitor the daemon's operations.  The server also
      provides a networked API for accessing current and historical
      values for each IOC.  The CGI clients on the web server use
      this interface to create web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Client programs run on other hosts, in two different ways,
      both utilizing the alive API for communication.  The first
      way is to read all or part of the current alive database,
      while the second is to subscribe for event notifications when
      there is a change in an IOC's status (this second way is not
      fully operational right now).  The alive system comes with a
      database client that allows full access to the data from the
      command line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alive record is meant to be generic in nature, and the
      operating system support for the Alive record is meant
      to match those that EPICS supports.  The database server
      code, which resides outside of EPICS, specifically targets
      Linux and its design is tailored for the needs of our group.
    </p>
       
    <h2>EPICS Record</h2><hr>
        
    <img src="html-files/aliveRecordEnvVars.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20;margin-top:20">
    <img src="html-files/aliveRecord.png" align="right" style="margin-left:20;margin-top:20">
        
    <p>
      This record is distributed as an optional module for EPICS,
      and can be
      found <a href="https://github.com/epics-modules/alive">online
        at github</a>.  It is part of the synApps distribution
      developed at the Advanced Photon Source.  To the right is a
      screenshot of an active alive record's accessible information
      (as seen through a screen for the EPICS graphical user
      interface <b>medm</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The alive module has no dependencies on other EPICS modules
      or external libraries.  Complete documentation is provided
      with the source, such as for
      <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/epics-modules/alive/blob/master/documentation/aliveRecord.html">
        configuration and record use</a>, and
      <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/epics-modules/alive/blob/master/documentation/aliveServer.html">
        network protocol implementation</a> for creating your own
      heartbeat monitoring program (on the central server).
    </p>
    <p>
      The record's main job is to send UDP heartbeat packets to the
      remote server at a fixed interval (with a default of 15
      seconds), to let it know that the IOC is still running.  It
      also listens on a TCP port that allows the remote server to
      retrieve all the environment variable data along with
      operating system dependent data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heartbeat packets contain the IOC's name, the boot time
      (or incarnation), the current time, the IP address of the
      IOC, the UDP port used to send the packets, a user-defined
      64-bit integer message, and other information.  The
      combination of IP address, port, and incarnation provide a
      unique identifier for any particular instance of an IOC,
      allowing multiple instances running with the same IOC name to
      be identified (a conflict).  As these are UDP packets, the
      record does not need to care whether they make it to the
      remote server or not, and will send them regardless of
      whether the network or server is up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alive record will only respond to the remote server on
      the TCP port, to reduce chances of interference due to
      probing from other computers.  When the remote server
      connects, the alive record will not read anything but rather
      write all of its information and then close the port, not
      allowing the remote host to keep the port open.  The data
      sent is the names and values of the environment variables
      that are specified in the alive record's fields, as well as
      the operating system dependent infomation, which can be about
      the user account and machine used to start the IOC for a
      server or the boot parameters for an embedded system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 64-bit integer message value that is sent with the
      hearbeats is intended to have a generic use, although it is
      meant for conveying additional status values.  The user
      defines the meaning of it, and how to respond to its values.
      In our case, we have started using bits of the value as error
      flags as caught by other records.
    </p>
          
    <h2>Database Daemon</h2><hr>

    <p>
      The alive database is provided by the alive daemon,
      <b>alived</b>, which runs on an independent server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daemon accepts the heartbeats on a UDP port from the
      alive records of any IOC.  The daemon drops invalid packets,
      and the correct ones are checked against the internal
      database. If valid heartbeat's IOC has never been seen
      before, it is added, otherwise the existing IOC is updated.
      If the IOC has a new instance (such as from rebooting or
      moving to a new host), the IOC's alive record is then
      contacted on its advertised TCP port, and its environment
      variables and operating system dependent information are
      retrieved and updated in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deamon determines the IOC's running state from its
      heartbeats.  If an IOC has not sent a heartbeat within a
      certain number of periods (with the period interval sent in
      the most recent valid heartbeat), the IOC is considered
      failed; otherwise it is considered to be up and running.  If
      there are multiple instances of an IOC considered up that
      have heartbeats which interleave in time, then the IOC is
      considered to be in conflict (such as starting the same IOC
      twice); care has to be taken as a rebooted IOC will have two
      instances considered up (as the previous one has not timed
      out), but this normal situation can be identified as the
      heartbeats of the earlier instance strictly come before those
      of the later instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events for an IOC are also generated by the heartbeats.
      These are recorded for future reference with event time, IP
      address, and message value. They are:
      <ul>
        <li>BOOT: New instance has started.</li>
        <li>FAIL: Last instance no longer sending heartbeats.</li>
        <li>RECOVER: Instance previously considered failed has
          sent a new heartbeat.  Happens when there are network
          issues.</li>
        <li>MESSAGE: A new message value has been sent.</li>
        <li>CONFLICT_START: Multiple instances are running
          concurrently.</li>
        <li>CONFLICT_STOP: Conflict is over, as only one instance is
          determined to be active.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      
    <h2>Control Program</h2><hr>
        
    <p>
      The daemon runs in the background of the server, and has a
      special control program.  The program communicates with the
      daemon through an IPC socket, so the program has to be run
      locally on the daemon's host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The control program can stop the daemon, directly query the
      database, take database snapshots, and present debugging
      information.  Snapshots are text data files, and can be taken
      periodically in order to create a historical record that can
      be analyzed.
    </p>

    <h2>Client API</h2><hr>
        
    <p>
      The IOC information can be retrieved remotely for clients
      using the alive API library.  This library allows the client
      to retrieve information of several types:
      <ul>
        <li>The current IOC operational status, as well as the
          environment variable and operating system dependent
          data.</li>
        <li>The IOC event history.</li>
        <li>The IOC conflict information detailing the instances
          in conflict.</li>
        <li>A list of all IOC instances seen for a period of time,
          active or not.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Event notification will also handled by the alive API, but it
      works differently.  Instead of requesting the data, the
      client asks for a subscription along with a callback
      subroutine.  Whenever an event occurs, the daemon sends the
      event and operational information to the subscribers.  This
      system is not fully operational at this point.
